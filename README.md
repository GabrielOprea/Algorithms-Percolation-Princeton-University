# Algorithms-Part-1

This assignment is part of an Online Algorithms Course I took. The first
task was building the Percolation.java class, which applies the Union-Find
algorithm to decide whether a system of a n by n grid percolates(that is, there
exists a path conecting the first row to the last row).

The second part consists of a Monte Carlo simulation of the above algorithm.
Sites are opened randomly, and various statistics about percolation are
calculated, like mean, standard deviation, confidence interval.
